Why are we talking about cats? Because cats are important. And additionally, because cats and religions is an exciting connection that we want to bring closer to you here. 

Animals are of different importance for many religions. They have different roles in the history of religion. Animals as food, animals as offerings, the question of purity or impurity, the sanctification and worship of animals, or the connection between animals and deities. All of these areas and more can be studied in religious studies. But not all animals have the same meanings. Some have special roles, others are not mentioned in religious texts. Here we take a closer look at one example and ask the question: What role do cats play in religions? 

This website shows how to outline a research project using a homepage. At the end of the project, this page will also be used to present results. In this way, research procedures and results can be derived in a transparent and understandable way.
