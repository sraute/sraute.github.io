## Cats in religious studies 

Animals are of importance for many religions. They have different roles in the history of religion. Animals as food, animals as offerings, the question of purity or impurity, the sanctification and worship of animals, or the connection between animals and deities. All of these areas and more can be studied in religious studies. But not all animals have the same meanings. Some have special roles, others are not mentioned in religious texts. Here we take a closer look at one example and ask the question: What role do cats play in religions?

## Cats here and cats there 
Cats have settled in different subbreeds all over the world. For this reason, there are also references to cats in different religions worldwide. Some of the stories are very old - so cats were a topic of everyday interaction with humans very early. 

### Not all cats are the same
We agree, of course, that all cats are beautiful. However, for the consideration of the religious studies project on this website, I have to draw some distinctions.  
Namely in the breed, size and color. Why exactly the coat color of a cat can also be relevant, is something I intend to explore in more detail in the coming weeks. 

### More information coming soon - So stay tuned for new updates!
